# Setup
## Install Node.js
I recommend using **NVM** for being able to use different Node.js versions across different projects.
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update

Make sure to install version **node**
```
$ nvm install node
```
You can confirm which version you are on by running
```
$ nvm ls
```
Switch between nvm verstions by running `nvm use <version>`, so `nvm use node`

## Insall all Node packets
```
$ npm install
```

## Get Nodemon
```
$ npm install -g nodemon
```

# Run web server and socket
## Web server
```
$ npm start
```
## Web Socket sever
```
$ npm run ws
```
